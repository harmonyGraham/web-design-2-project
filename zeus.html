               <b>KING OF THE GODS</b>
               <br>
               king of the gods, was attributed to the planet Jupiter. He was the child of Cronus and Rhea. 
               As Cronus had deposed his father, Ouranus, Zeus’ destiny was to overthrow Cronus and his ‘Titans’. 
               Today, a titan has positive connotations, but it was originally used as a pejorative term for the sons of Ouranus. 
               After many years of battling, the Titans were finally defeated, Zeus punished all who had opposed him. Some he 
               eventually forgave but he gave Cronus the humiliating punishment of swinging a scythe of time, mercilessly cutting 
               through the ages. From this, he gained the name ‘Father Time’ and many of our words to do with time are associated 
               with Cronus: ‘chronological’, ‘chronometer’, ‘synchronous’ and many more

               JUPITER
               </b> 
               <br>
               Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
               Jupiter’s familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years

               <b>ZEUS</b>
               <br>
               Zeus was well known for his amorousness—a source of perpetual discord with his wife, Hera—and he had many love affairs with both mortal and immortal women. In order to achieve his amorous designs, Zeus frequently assumed animal forms, such as that of a cuckoo when he ravished Hera, a swan when he ravished Leda, or a bull when he carried off Europa.
               Notable among his offspring were the twins Apollo and Artemis, by the Titaness Leto; Helen and the Dioscuri, by Leda of Sparta; Persephone, by the goddess Demeter; Athena, born from his head after he had swallowed the Titaness Metis; Hephaestus, Hebe, Ares, and Eileithyia, by his wife, Hera; Dionysus, by the goddess Semele; and many others.
